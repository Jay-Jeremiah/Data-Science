Classes - A blueprint of the objects, can be a template.

Objects - An entity that we interact with

Attribute - the object characteristic

Method - the action that the object can do

Incase of two objects of the same class, python has to diffrentiate them
We use *self* keyword to do so

Self points to the memory address where each object of the class is stored

class - keyword to define a class

init method - stores initial values for all the instance attributes
    Created like +___init___()
    first argument must be self
    we access the attributes using the dot 
The attributes inside the init method are specific for the instance called instance attributes
Attributes that are shared between all instances are called class attributes and defined outside the init method
